  caption: I also want to emphasize the importance of using your vent lights. There
    are no cameras right in front of the vent doors, so if you can't find one of
    the teacher animatronics, make sure to use the vent lights. You might only have
    a few seconds to react- not that'd you'd be in any danger or something. I'm not
    saying that.
