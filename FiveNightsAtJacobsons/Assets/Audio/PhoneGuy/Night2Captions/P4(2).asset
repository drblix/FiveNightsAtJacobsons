  caption: Oh, I almost forgot to tell you about Ms. Roush. That one gets, um, rather
    angry if her music stops playing. Luckily, we recently rigged your camera system
    to be able to wind her music box remotely. So, every now and then, go check on
    her in the cameras and the wind the box as necessary.
