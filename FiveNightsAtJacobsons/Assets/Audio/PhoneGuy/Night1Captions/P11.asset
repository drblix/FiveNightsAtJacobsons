  caption: And remember, you can check the vents on the left and right by clicking
    the white button, and lock them down with the red button. If something shows
    up in the hallway in front of you, just flash it a few times with your flashlight
    and hope that it goes away. If not- there's a shock button stationed in your
    office to power down any animatronics within the proximity of it.
