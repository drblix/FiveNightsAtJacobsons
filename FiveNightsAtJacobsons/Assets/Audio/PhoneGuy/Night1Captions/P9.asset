  caption: They'll probably see you as a student breaking into the school after hours.
    Now, since that's against the rules here at Jacobson, they'll probably try to
    send you to detention. Um, now that wouldn't be so bad, if the detention hall
    itself wasn't a torture chamber under the girls bathroom where the teachers draw
    and quarter you.
