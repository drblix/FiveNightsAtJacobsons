  caption: Blah blah blah- now that might sound bad I know. But there's really nothing
    to worry about! Well- the animatronic teachers here do get a bit quirky at night,
    but do I blame them? Nah! If I were forced teach those same kids for 20 years
    and I never got a bath? You'd imagine I'd be a bit irritable at night too.
